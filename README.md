So, there are a lot of cool things people are doing with HPMOR. Submitting Britpick corrections, writing alternate chapters, publishing in multiple formats, meta-fics, tracking diffs between revisions...it would be awesome if there were a way to organize all that and track the different versions and developments.
So I made one.
It's just a straight html pull from the site right now, but I think there's enough brain here that we can patch it up pretty quick.
My vision for this includes Makefiles for generating PDFs/epubs/whatever, branches for rewrites of different parts (like the alternate version of 85 that popped up a few weeks ago, or the original star-gazing version of that same chapter), etc. Wanna help?
